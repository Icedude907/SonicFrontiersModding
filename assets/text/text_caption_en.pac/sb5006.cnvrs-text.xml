      You know, I've noticed that there's no sign of any animals on this island. I would expect some to be around in a place so full of nature. This isn't your doing, is it?

      Don't blame me for that! According to the records in Cyber Space, all of the native creatures were transported to another island during the battle that led to the extinction of the Ancients.
