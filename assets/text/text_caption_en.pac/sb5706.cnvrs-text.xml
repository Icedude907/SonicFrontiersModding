      I am not picking up any signals like those of the Doctor's, or your friends, from those areas. The Big the Cat that you saw is most probably an illusion recreated from your memory.

      The fact that you were able to converse with the illusion and believe it was real speaks to how vivid a memory you have of him. Normally, traveling between spaces is said to cause a feeling of danger, at such a level that even you would be able to pick up on it.

      Well, it was just Big, so it didn't feel dangerous. But it's good to know that the real Big is out there, safe in the jungle somewhere.
