      Mortal. You have served your purpose. 
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_002" id="2783921882">
      Now face your end.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_003" id="2783921883">
      I am the all-consuming void.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_004" id="2783921884">
      What can one mote of golden light illuminate within the abyss?
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_005" id="2783921885">
      Countless stars. Countless worlds. Countless lives.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_006" id="2783921886">
      All fell to me. All brought to nothing.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_007" id="2783921887">
      All the teeming chaos of Creation?
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_008" id="2783921888">
      Brought to order. To neutrality. To nothing.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_009" id="2783921889">
      I saw your mind as you ran through my prison.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_010" id="2783922007">
      You have fought machines and gods. They were mighty.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_011" id="2783922008">
      They were finite. I am infinite. I am nothing.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_012" id="2783922009">
      You struggle as so many have done before.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_013" id="2783922010">
      You will be consumed like all those before you.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_014" id="2783922011">
      I saw your mind. Your courage never waivered. Why?
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_015" id="2783922012">
      Arrogance? Ignorance? Stupidity?
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_016" id="2783922013">
      I was contained once. Once. Is that why?
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_017" id="2783922014">
      My captors bent time and space.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_018" id="2783922015">
      My captors built a whole reality to contain me.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_019" id="2783922016">
      My captors burned their souls away to fuel their engines.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_020" id="2783922134">
      And you?
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_021" id="2783922135">
      You glitter. You fly about me like a gnat.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_022" id="2783922136">
      I am inevitable. I cannot be denied.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_023" id="2783922137">
      You strike this incarnation with all your might. It changes nothing.
    </text>
    <text name="sy4500_024" id="2783922138">
      You are not brave. You are not victorious.
    </text>

      No matter what form I take...
