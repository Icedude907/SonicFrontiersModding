      It looks like there are gimmicks hidden all over the place. What I want to know is, what was with that pinball in the volcano on Chaos Island?

      It's a part of a device that controls volcanic activity. When you turn on the switch at the top of the pinball, the volcano is activated and erupts.

      But it would be dangerous if the volcano could be erupted easily. That's probably why they made a door that only reacts to a special kind of energy and put the switch in a place that's hard to reach.

      As you accumulate points with the pinball, the energy ball gets charged up and opens the door.

      I figured the device was something like that, since the volcano erupted after I cleared the thing. But why was it designed with a pinball?

      That's not exactly clear... but maybe it was just a playful idea on the part of whoever developed it. Engineers tend to be like that.
