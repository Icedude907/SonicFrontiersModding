      Wasn't there a similar pyramid-looking thing on Kronos Island? Are they related? Maybe to shoot something into the sky?

      That section was essentially a harbor. Not only for spaceships but also for other ships traveling to the other islands.

      There used to be a resting area in the lower levels, an important space for the ancient travelers... Now it is but an architectural curiosity.
