      I've seen those giant devices all over Chaos Island. Judging by their color scheme and how new they are, I'm guessing you made them?

      Ho ho ho! You've got a sharp eye, Tails. Indeed, those were power generation devices I built as I investigated ancient technology!

      The Death Egg Robot and all of the other machines I brought in may be amazing, but they're useless without an energy supply. That's why I prepared a power generator that utilizes geothermal energy from volcanoes.

      If only I had more time, I would have put generators throughout this island to power a super weapon... Such a shame.

      Maybe the reason the Death Egg Robot's beam was able to find the underground passage wasn't just because of the hacking, but because of Eggman's energy supply? I really don't want to thank him, though...
