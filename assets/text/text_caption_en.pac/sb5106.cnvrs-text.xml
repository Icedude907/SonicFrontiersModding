      I've been looking for weapons that we could use on the hunt for Emeralds, but there doesn't seem to be anything.

      There was a cannon on Ares Island, but it was fired to drain the water in the oasis. I'm guessing we don't have time to go looking for more shells.

      Hmm, why would the Ancients waste precious water in a desert?

      I'll bet that cannon was a device that controlled water storage. The oasis must have served as a dam, and it was designed so the position of the faucet could be adjusted.

      A dam? But all the water went down the drain...

      The drained water should have been redirected into various watering holes. If only there was something like that cannon from Ares Island here...
