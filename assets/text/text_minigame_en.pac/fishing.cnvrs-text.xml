      It appears Amy Rose has been dragged into the mix.
      Clever girl. Tenacious. She’s come a long way since being an easy pawn in my schemes to ensnare Sonic. It seems like she had some trouble finding herself. But when you hang around with someone with as big an ego as Sonic, self-identification has to be a challenge.
