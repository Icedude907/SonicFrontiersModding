         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      
         1. Definitions.
      
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
      
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
      
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
      
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      
         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
      
         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
      
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
      
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
      
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
      
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
      
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "&lt;&gt;"

            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

                                  2006-Jan-27
      
                          Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
                David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
      
      
      
      Introduction
      ============
      
        The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
        some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
        various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
        FreeType Project.
      
        This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
        which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
        affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
        documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
      
        This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
        (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
        and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
        alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
      
          o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
            interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
      
          o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
            full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
      
          o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
            it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
            somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
            FreeType code. (`credits')
      
        We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
        software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
        We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
        assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
      
      
        Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
        credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
        encourage you to use the following text:

          Portions of this software are copyright © &lt;year&gt; The FreeType

        Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you
        actually use.

      --------------
      
        Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',

        distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
        Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,

      --------------
      
        THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
        WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR

      2. Redistribution
      -----------------
      
        This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
        irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
        display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
        sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
        forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
        authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
        herein, subject to the following conditions:
      
          o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
            (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
            the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
            documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
            original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
            files.
      
          o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
            states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
            FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
            encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
            documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
      
        These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
        the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
        our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
        to us.
      
      3. Advertising
      --------------
      
        Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
        the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
        purposes without specific prior written permission.
      
        We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
        following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
        or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
        `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
      
        As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
        accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
        material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
        authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
        Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
        Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
        of this license.
      
      4. Contacts
      -----------
      
        There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
      
          o freetype@nongnu.org
