##### Diffing binary files
- No built-in method of doing this in git
- No VSCode support either (Check here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor/issues/47)
- Consider using VBinDiff or https://github.com/8051Enthusiast/biodiff to help you? Maybe even exporting the table generated by 010 when applying binary templates.
