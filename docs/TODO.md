TODO: Pursuit Kick (different from the Sonic Battle Persuit Attack - Sonic Eagle, which is the final jab holding down.)
Cyclone Kick / Charge Attack should only use pursuit as a follow up if the final hit connects
Pursuit should be on the unlock tree.
TODO: Disable cyclone kick until touching the ground after doing once (currently you can cyclone, homing, cyclone, loop)
TODO: Rail Crouch
TODO: Modify rail boost to consume a chunk on activation, set to a minimum speed, and increase the speed limit as time goes on
TODO: Make air boost consume a chunk when pressed and a bit while held.
TODO: Make ground boost consume a lesser chunk when pressed
TODO: Decrease koko boost expansion rewards (late game Sonic should have 3 meters not 5)
TODO: Decrease fishing koko amounts
TODO: Decrease upgrade koko amounts
TODO: Decrease max levels
TODO: Rejigger unlock table
Phantom rush to character event 1, Grand Slam to first ability, Cross Slash post Rhea events, Cyclone to Chaos Island, 
FIXME: Homing shot has a few bugs + does not last long enough to launch the 8th shot.
TODO: Have homing shot increase attack range.
TODO: Lower Sonic's base homing range

FIXME: Wild Rush's final camera angle is slightly too close to large enemies (non-super)

TODO: Sonic boom slowdown on hold.
