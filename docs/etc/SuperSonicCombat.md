Giganto: 75k HP
Wyvern: 50k (ok)
Knight: 60k (low?)
Ring drain: 1 per second when not in some cutscenes.

Considering Giganto:
Base damage: 10

- Level 1 players should do 3 digits on the first hit (120)
- Combo hits 1,2,3 - 0.8x each      (80 each - 240 total)
- Persuit - Should it be avaliable? (230)
- Final hits do big numbers but their damage varies by direction & speed (250-350) (N 35 U 29 D 25 LR 32 )

One neutral combo averages to 710
Phantom rush this jumps to (120+590*1.5) -> 1005 damage
Duration of a combo is about 2s. (2m 30s of phantom rush whaling)

- Stomping (300)

Grand Slam does 3200 (about 23 to destroy)
- For Giganto the cost-benefit of Grand Slam needs to be readjusted. Its awesome

-----------------
In general: numbers when as Sonic probably need to be scaled up to 15. (and max up to 45)
Lore wise: Super sonic being 10x as damaging at least is maybe pushing it
Gameplay wise: Moves like Sonic Boom seemingly suffer from a lack of more precise numbers - damage rounding thresholds are significant and this would make it less so.
  Combo hits should do multi-digit damage

Enemies would also need to be scaled (not bosses)

Move staling is a must if the combat is to have some more detailed thought put into it.

# The philosophy of the boss fight:
The bosses should be more of an outlet than an analytical thing.
That being said getting a base level of optimisation at the moment is extremely easy to figure out, (use any time freezing ability).

At the moment I'm balancing Giganto so that:
- an idiot completely on autopilot would be able to win with upgrades, 
- the average player (hard mode, combat 20) could win in 160 rings (2 min 40)
- a knowledgeable level 1 could chew through Giganto in 100 rings (1 min 40).
