## Sonic Frontiers Text Editing Workflow
I know nothing about modding Sonic games.

This is a project I used to modify in-game text.  
It generates a working HedgeModManager mod for use in the game.

Since the required files for a mod are in the root of the project (`./raw/`, `mod.ini`)
this repository can be cloned into your mods directory for convenient development.

Some assembly required:
- Sonic Frontiers must be installed.
- The build scripts are written in rust. So you'll want it installed (along with an internet connection to download some packages)
- Requires `HedgeArcPack` as part of [HedgeLib](https://github.com/Radfordhound/HedgeLib)
- Requires [`PuyoTextEditor`](https://github.com/nickworonekin/puyo-text-editor) (for now)

Some resources I've used on my modding escapades (not all used here):
- [CamoRF/Sonic-Frontiers-Mod-Hub](https://github.com/CamoRF/Sonic-Frontiers-Mod-Hub)
- [blueskythlikesclouds/RflTemplates](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/RflTemplates)
- The source code to [HedgeModManager](https://github.com/thesupersonic16/HedgeModManager)
  and [its Community Codes](https://github.com/hedge-dev/HMMCodes)
- [HedgeDocs](https://hedgedocs.com/)
