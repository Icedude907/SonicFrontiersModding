## Sonic Frontiers Text Editing Workflow
I know nothing about modding Sonic games.

This is my attempt to teach myself how to modify the game and undertake some reverse engineering.  
This project holds various game modifications and a tool to convert files into game-specific formats and generate a working HedgeModManager mod.

### **NOTE:** This is not a complete mod intended for playthroughs.
Rather it is a collection of (unfinished) concepts in an attempt to learn.
Some day I may give it the polish it needs, but not at the moment.

Since the required files for a mod are in the root of the project (`./raw/`, `mod.ini`)
this repository can be cloned into your mods directory for convenient development.

#### Documentation:
There are a number of useful documents in the [docs](/docs/) folder which may help you in:
- Building/Editing the project
- Learning more about the modding ecosystem (from my limited knowledge)
- Learning more about the game's internals.
- or just seeing my ramblings
